This is a Palladium addon the adds a bunch of superpowers to the game!

Current powers:
- Cosmic Seer (Overpowered Dev Superpower)
- Luck Manipulation
- Telekinesis
- Cryokinesis
- Explosions

Planned Powers:
- Atlantean
- Some kind of Chara rip-off :)

Please note that these powers require custom items from a Forge mod that does not yet exist (I'm making it). Once the addon has sufficient content, I will update it to a Modrinth page with the actual .jar file.

This addon requires Palladium and Arrze's Superhero Multiverse in order to load correctly.
